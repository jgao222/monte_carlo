This is an interactive monte carlo simulation for approximating the value of pi.
Just put all the .py scripts in the same directory and run `monte_carlo.py` to
run the program.

Click the buttons labeled with numbers to generate X amount of points randomly
and update the value of pi with however many land inside the shapes.

'R' clears the display of points. 'SHIFT + R' clears the display of points, and
resets the calculated value as well as everything else.
